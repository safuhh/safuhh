Hey, I’m Safvan — a developer who likes building things that actually work, not just look good on screenshots.
I vibe with clean code, good logic, and that satisfying feeling when everything finally stops throwing errors.

🚀 What I Do

Build full-stack apps

Fix bugs that make no sense

Learn new tech faster than my sleep schedule recovers

Break stuff… then fix it again (classic dev moment)

💡 My Tech Moodboard

React, Tailwind

Node.js, Express

MongoDB

Learning AI tools & automation (because future-proofing, duh)

🎯 Goals

Become a better problem-solver every day

Ship projects I’m proud of

Make dev life smoother, smarter, and a bit more fun

⚡ Fun Fact

I debug like a detective, build like a craftsman, and sometimes code like it's 3 AM even when it's not.
