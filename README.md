I’m Safvan, a full-stack developer with a strong focus on modern web development, AI, machine learning, and data science. I work with React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on the frontend, and Python, Django, and Node.js on the backend. I enjoy building clean user interfaces, scalable backend systems, and intelligent models using tools like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. My workflow revolves around writing clean, maintainable code and creating practical solutions that solve real problems. I’m continuously improving my skills, especially in full-stack development, backend architecture, and advanced AI workflows.
